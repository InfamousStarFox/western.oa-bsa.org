The National Order of the Arrow Committee has released an updated revision to the Field Operations Guide for 2009. The Field Operations Guide (FOG) provides information on OA National and Regional Organization, Section Rules, Lodge Assistance Program, and Section Conclave Guidelines. It is an essential reference for all section leadership and can be helpful for the lodge leadership as well.

The updated Field Operations Guide can be downloaded at the <a href='http://www.oa-bsa.org/resources/pubs/#fog'>National Order of the Arrow website</a>.
