The National Leadership Seminar is our Order's premier leadership training experience. Organized by the region in various locations around the country annually, there are two more opportunities to attend this event in 2008:
<br /><br />
- October 10-12, 2008  	Lost Valley ($135)<br />
- November 14-16, 2008 	Coast Guard Station Alameda ($130)
<br /><br />
Anyone in the region who satisfies all of the requirements to attend the NLS is invited to any seminar. The requirements include holding a leadership position within the OA or the potential to hold one in the future, to be mature enough to handle an intense 3-day course in leadership dynamics, and to have lodge adviser approval. If interested in attending either of the seminars this fall, please <a href="http://western.oa-bsa.org/program/training/nls.php">begin the registration process</a> as soon as possible.
