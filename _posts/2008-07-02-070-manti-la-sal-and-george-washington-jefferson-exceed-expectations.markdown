ArrowCorps5 is over half complete, and thus far it has been a resounding success. The last two sites, Manti-La Sal in Utah and George Washington-Jefferson in Virginia, both exceeded expectations. Work in Utah consisted of clearing Tamarisk, an invasive tree, out of the most beautiful southwestern canyons imaginable. Buckhorn Wash, the focus of the project, was completely cleared and all together nearly 13,000 acres were cleared of Tamarisk. The majority of the projects in Virginia involved trail construction and restoration, and the Forest Service announced that it was naming a 19-mile loop of trail the ArrowCorps Trail in our honor. One of the other projects in Virginia involved building campsites, which were in use before participants even left the forest.
<br /><br />
All three completed sites have been life-changing experiences for many, and everyone has had a great time. The upcoming two sites, Shasta-Trinity and Bridger-Teton (both in the West!), will exceed this tradition of success. We hope to see you there!
