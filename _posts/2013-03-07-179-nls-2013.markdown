<p><br /><a href="program/training/nls"><img src="images/logos/national-leadership-seminar@2x.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>Want to get some of the best Leadership Training the Boy Scouts can offer? Then you should attend NLS! National Leadership Seminar (or NLS for short) offers one of the best Leadership Training programs available to scouts, and it is made specificially for OA members! In addition, NLS isn't just your average, lecture-based training. Almost every lesson is done in an activity or discussion format, so you can learn the skills you need to succeed without being put to sleep. So if you want to get the leadership skills to be an officer in your Chapter, Lodge or even Section, NLS is the place you need to be!&nbsp;</p>
