Gene passed away early on the morning of October 15, 2011. He was a truly dedicated Scouter and Arrowman.<p>
Instead of flowers, the family requests you send a donation in Gene's name to the Maury Clancy Indian Campership Fund.  Contributions can be mailed to: <br><i>

Gene will be greatly missed by all those who knew and worked beside him to increase the presence and success of the Order of the Arrow and all Scouting.   Please keep Gene's wife Judy and their family in your prayers.<p>
