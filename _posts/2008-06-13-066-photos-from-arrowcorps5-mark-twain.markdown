<img src='images/ac5marktwain.jpg' width=133 height=145 align=right>Tomorrow marks the completion of the first 

of five week-long service projects held at several 

national forests this summer. All together, work at 

these five sites comprise ArrowCorps5 (pronounced Arrow 

Corps Five), the Order of the Arrow's largest service 

project since World War II. With only hours remaining at 

the site in the Mark Twain National Forest, Missouri, 

Arrowmen finish up a week of conservation work, removing 

invasive Red cedar from glade regions and restoring up 

to 150 acres of native grass areas.
<br /><br />
Arrowmen will be participating in similar conservation 

work in the forests at Manti-La Sal, Utah June 14-21; 

George Washington-Jefferson, Virginia June 21-28; 

Shasta-Trinity, California July 12-19; and Bridger-

Teton, Wyoming July 26-August 2. By the end of the 

summer, volunteers will have contributed an estimated 

250,000 man-hours to the conservation of our nation's 

forests.
<br /><br />
Photos from the Mark Twain, Missouri site are now 

available for viewing in the <a href='http://western.oa-bsa.org/gallery'>Photo Gallery</a>. Additional photos may 

be added as they become available. Photos 16-84 are courtesy of the USDA Forest Service.
