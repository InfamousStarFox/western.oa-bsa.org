<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}images/posts/2012NationalAward/eugnatservice.jpg" alt="" align="right" />The recognitions subcommittee of the National Order of the Arrow Committee and the Western Region Order of the Arrow are proud to announce the selection of two Lodges from the Western Region to earn the <a href="program/awards/eugcamping">E. Urner Goodman Camping Award</a> and <a href="program/awards/natservice">National Service Award</a>.</p>

The Award is presented to two Lodges from each region every year that best exemplify the Camping Spirit of the Boy Scouts of America National Honor Society.

<p>The National Service Award (shown on the far right) was established in 1999 to recognize lodges in each region that have performed outstanding service, both in a qualitative and a quantitative sense, to their council. The award is presented to a Lodge that has done a large and meaningful service project for their Council to benefit their local scouting program. The Award is presented to two Lodges from each region that completes the best service project to benefit their local Scouting program. The 2012 Award winners in the Western Region are:</p>
