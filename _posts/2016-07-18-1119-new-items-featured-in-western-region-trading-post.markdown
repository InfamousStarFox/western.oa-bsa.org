The Western Region Trading Post is back - and with new items too!  In 
addition to the ever popular and eye catching Western Region Belt 
Buckle, the Western Region Trading Post is proud to present the 2016 
Western Region patch set.<br>
<br>

First on the list is the 2016 Western Region Chenille Patch.   A 
beautiful patch set on a white background, it features the majestic 
mustang at the center of the patch, which represents the region’s totem.
  This is definitely a must for someone looking to decorate a jacket or 
blanket!<br>
<br>
Next is the 2016 Western Region Back Patch.  Measuring 4” by 8.5”, it is
 a bit longer and slimmer than the Chenille Patch.  Centered on the 
patch is the national logo of the Order of the Arrow, the mustang is 
featured above and the words “Western Region” are emblazoned below the 
national logo, all of which is set on a black background.<br>
<br>
And finally is the 2016 Western Region Pocket Patch.  This patch is 
approved for field uniform use.  Set on a black background with a red 
border, a red arrow across a white strip is centered horizontally on the
 patch.  Again, the region’s totem of the mustang is featured above the 
arrow and the words Western Region below it.  This is a great way for 
Arrowmen to represent the Western Region at any Scouting event.<br>
