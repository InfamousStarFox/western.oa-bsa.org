First on the list is the 2016 Western Region Chenille Patch.   A
beautiful patch set on a white background, it features the majestic
mustang at the center of the patch, which represents the region’s totem.
This is definitely a must for someone looking to decorate a jacket or blanket

Next is the 2016 Western Region Back Patch.  Measuring 4” by 8.5”, it is
a bit longer and slimmer than the Chenille Patch.  Centered on the
patch is the national logo of the Order of the Arrow, the mustang is
featured above and the words “Western Region” are emblazoned below the
national logo, all of which is set on a black background

<a href="http://tradingpost.oa-bsa.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=WR%2D011" target="_blank"><img src="http://tradingpost.oa-bsa.org/v/vspfiles/photos/WR-011-1.jpg" style="float:right; height:100px;" /></a>
And finally is the 2016 Western Region Pocket Patch.  This patch is
approved for field uniform use.  Set on a black background with a red
border, a red arrow across a white strip is centered horizontally on the
patch.  Again, the region’s totem of the mustang is featured above the
arrow and the words Western Region below it.  This is a great way for
Arrowmen to represent the Western Region at any Scouting event
