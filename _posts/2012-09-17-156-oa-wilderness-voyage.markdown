<p><a href="http://adventure.oa-bsa.org/index.php?p=voyage" target="_blank"><img src="images/ntwvoyage.gif" alt="Charles L. Sommers Canoe Base - Click for more info" align="right" border=0></a>The National Order of the Arrow is offering you an opportunity to join Arrowmen 
  from across the country in cheerful service and the formation of lasting brotherhood 
  on the pristine US/Canadian Boundary Waters. Under the direction of the United 
  States Forest Service, experienced Charles L. Sommers staff members with strong 
  Order of the Arrow backgrounds will lead participants on a two week voyage into 
  the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW).</p>
<p>The program is a fourteen-day experience inspired by the traditions of the 
  French and Canadian Voyageurs who ventured the northern wilderness during the 
  1700-1800's. Traveling thousands of miles by water and portage, these Voyageurs 
  were hired to haul goods and furs to trade with Native Americans and Europeans. 
  In the spirit of these adventurers, Arrowmen will embark on a voyage that is 
  twofold. One-half of the OA Northern Tier Wilderness Voyage focuses on portage 
  trail and campsite maintenance within the Boundary Waters. The remaining expedition 
  is spent on a canoeing adventure that is planned and chosen by the participants 
  in the program. In other words, each crew plans their own voyage! However, the 
  program is not simply portage trail work, camping, and canoeing. The OA Northern 
  Tier Wilderness Voyage is ultimately a journey that challenges Scouts mentally, 
  physically, and spiritually.</p>
<p> Portage trail work is tough and serious. The worksite experience is full of 
  long, strenuous days requiring a great deal of physical effort. Participants 
  are expected to work with great diligence as the tasks being accomplished are 
  designed to benefit generations of Scouts and non-Scouts in the Boundary Waters 
  Wilderness. In addition to mastering portage trail maintenance techniques, Scouts 
  will strengthen their leadership skills, learn advanced wilderness and low-impact 
  camping skills, learn wilderness safety techniques, participate in many motivational 
  activities, and receive special OA instruction. The project's mission is to 
  maintain, reinforce, and intensify the purpose of the Order of the Arrow through 
  Scout camping traditions. Camping enhances and builds stronger programs and 
  people. Participants are expected to use their experience to benefit their troop, 
  chapter, lodge, and council programs.</p>
