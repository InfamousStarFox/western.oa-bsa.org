Brothers,<br>
The 16<sup>th</sup> annual Double Vigil Golf Tournament is right around the corner. Yes you read this correct. We will now be hosting this tournament on a Saturday. Our hope is this new format will enable all of our brothers from around the nation to participate. You&rsquo;ve spent the last few years working on this AMAZING Centennial year for the Order of the Arrow! Now it&rsquo;s time to take a load off, relax with your fellow brothers, family, and friends.&nbsp; With this change of days we are also hoping to increase participation. With this in mind we are asking all of past participants to help us recruit either one more player and or one more sponsor. Overall this weekend will be the best way to kick off the Second Century of the Order of the Arrow! Hope to see you in Phoenix!


<b>What to expect:</b> Lunch, 18 holes of wonderful golf in a 4-person Best-Ball Scramble Choose between Championship Flight or the Fellowship Flight. The first being an all and out battle for the Wadford Cup and the second being a more kickback flight focused more on fellowship, a relaxing evening social, raffle, meet the new National Officers, raising funds for the Legacy Fund, new best dressed contest for teams and individual, hospitality suite at the event hotel and much much more!
