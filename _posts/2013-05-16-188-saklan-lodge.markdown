<p>The Newest OA Lodge has just been named &nbsp;here in the Western Region! The Miwok and Esselen Lodges in Section W3S have just merged to form the new Lodge Saklan, named for their totem the Banana Slug! &nbsp;Currently no Lodge Flap has been released, but we all across the Region look forward to seeing the creation patch of our newest lodge!&nbsp;Congradulations to our newest Lodge, and we all look forward to seeing you represented at Jamboree this year!</p>
