<p>It's that time of year again! The <a href="resources/sections/doc_download/31-lodge-charter-application">2013 Lodge Charter Renewal Application</a>&nbsp;is now available online from the Western Region <a href="resources/resources-for-lodges"><em>Resources for Lodges</em></a> section. <a href="resources/sections/doc_download/32-lodge-charter-instructions">Directions</a>&nbsp;on how to use the 2013 Lodge Charter Renewal Application are a part of the Lodge Charter Renewal Kit mailed out to Lodges and can also be found online.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember</span> you need to fill this out and <strong>submit electronically, as well as print and send with signatures and check</strong>.</p>
<p>We strongly suggest you get your Charter started today. Every year several lodges wait until December 15th (or later) and then discover the council office is closed until after the 1st of the year. As a result neither a signature nor a check can be secured and remember, checks often take two weeks (or more) to process from the time they are requested. Don't delay!</p>
<p>Let's see to it that all of the Western Region lodges submit their paperwork <strong>before</strong> the other regions and make sure they remember that WEST IS BEST!</p>
