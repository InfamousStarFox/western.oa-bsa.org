Members of the National Order of the Arrow Committee, Region Chiefs, National Staff;
<p>
Steve Bradley and I just spent a delightful weekend with our new brothers in the Long Beach Area Council!!!
<p>
We presented the Council Scout Executive, youth officers, and Council President with the first new charter for an OA lodge in 42 years!!!
<p>
Today, the youth membership elected officers and selected Puvunga as their lodge name. It translates to "the gathering place". The lodge totem is a porpoise.
<p>
Prior to this weekend, the "newest lodge" has been Ashsin (#565) of Chamorro Council serving Guam, which  was formed in 1970.   The last lodge to form in the continental US in a council without a merger was Osceola Lodge (#564) chartered to Southwest Florida Council located in Fort Myers, FL in 1968. (thanks to Bill Topkis and Bill Loeble for  researching these facts).
<p>
38 youth members and 15 adults were inducted this weekend,  including the Council President and five members of the Council Executive Board.
<p>
They are off to a great start.
<p>
Below, are the captions that their staff adviser sent along with the photos as I flew home.
