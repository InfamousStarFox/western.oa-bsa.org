<center><img src=http://western.oa-bsa.org/images/2012dvchamps.jpg></center><br>On January 27, 2012 at Falcon Dunes Golf Course near Phoenix, Arizona, the 12th annual Double Vigil Golf Classic tournament brought together 55 golfers and an additional 16 donors, a new attendance record and a generous outpouring from other supporters.  The DVGC is open to anyone, regardless of Scouting or OA affiliation.  The event exceeded expectations in raising funds for the Boy Scouts of America's Maury Clancy American Indian Campership Fund, sending over $3,000 directly to the fund.  It also awarded two OA High Adventure scholarships, one recipient being our own W-4S Section Vice Chief, John Garcia.  Congratulations go to the tournament champions, Team Shoshone: Kasey Green, Bob Booker, Larry Abbott, and Frank Yoke.  The DVGC committee is excited at possibilities to increase participation and awareness of our cause, and look forward to continuing to grow the event.
