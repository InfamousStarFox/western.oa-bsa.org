Bloomington, Indiana.<br /><br />

This summit has a twofold purpose. The first will be to train key site
leadership and squad leaders for the 2008 ArrowCorps5. The second
purpose of the NCLS is to introduce to key leaders of lodges and
sections the 2008-2012 Order of the Arrow Strategic Plan. It will be
the first summit-type event held since the National Leadership Summit
of 1999.
