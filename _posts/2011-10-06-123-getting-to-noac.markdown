<img src=http://www.oawest.org/images/noactravel2012.jpg width=150 align=left style=padding-right:3px;padding-bottom:3px><b>Written by National Promotions Team - </b>Trains. Planes. Helicopters. Buses. Cars. Bicycles. Hiking. All ways you can get to NOAC 2012! Some ways are better than others, that is for sure. This fall,  each Order of the Arrow lodge will be recruiting Arrowmen to join their contingent for the 2012 National Order of the Arrow Conference. Lodges will provide youth and adult leadership to the contingent while en route and at the conference.
<p>
Talk with your lodge leadership about joining the contingent and attending NOAC 2012. Lodges will provide information on joining the contingent, travel plans, patches, and more. The conference fee will be $420 plus travel costs as determined by each lodge. Lodges will develop a travel schedule that may include touring while to and from East Lansing, Michigan. Check with your lodge leadership on the cool stops your contingent will make as you travel to NOAC.
<p>
Arrowmen may also attend NOAC 2012 as a staff member supporting the thousands of Arrowmen attending the conference. Staff registration will open this fall where Arrowmen can express interest in serving on one of the many NOAC committees. The staff fee is $420 plus the cost of travel. Many staff members travel with their lodge to NOAC, but may also plan their own travel schedule.
<p>
These are the two ways to get to NOAC. Join in the fun and remember, Next Stop: NOAC 2012!
