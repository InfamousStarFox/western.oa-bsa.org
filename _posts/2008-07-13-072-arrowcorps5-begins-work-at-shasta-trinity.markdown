Participants are beginning to arrive at the Shasta-Trinity project of ArrowCorps5 â€“ the fourth site this summer. Based at the Mt. Shasta Ski Resort, the headquarters is quite literally located in the shadow of Mt. Shasta. Despite the numerous fires south of the project, the U.S. Forest Service is still supporting the endeavor with about 15 personnel.
<br/><br/><br/>
<br/>Training is off and rolling, and, starting this morning everyone will be moving into the back-country to begin work on this magnificent project. Last evening marked the official opening with a campfire gathering, including a guest appearance from Smokey Bear.
<br>
<br>The project includes over 75 miles of trail work, including work on the Pacific Crest Trail, one of the National Scenic Trails. Other projects include 150 square miles of illegal dumpsite cleanup, as well as comfort station and lookout tower repairs.
<br>
<br>â€œEveryone involved in this project is prepared for the experience of a lifetime, and we anticipate that all expectations will be exceeded,â€ said Mark Hendricks, Western Region Chief and member of the ArrowCorps5 Instructor Corps.
<br>
<br>Stay tuned for an update at the end of the week.
