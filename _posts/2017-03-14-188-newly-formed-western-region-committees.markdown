After a very exciting and successful year of Scouting and Service, the Western Region is looking forward to an even
better 2017. We have formed two new committees to help us to reach that
objective; the Finance Committee, and the Camping Promotions Committee.
Additionally, the Communications Committee is always looking to add new
members, so they are also described below. If any of these look like something
you may be interested in, please fill out the Google Form at the bottom of the
page. [The Finance, Camping Promotions, and Communications Committee needs YOUR help to be successful!](http://buff.ly/2mkUN5a)

### Finance Committee

The Finance Committee, led by Section
W-6E Chief Jarod Peterman will be largely focused towards analyzing the Western
Region’s financial numbers to find what is efficient. The Finance Committee is
also looking for entrepreneurs for the items within our trading post with good
ideas for branded apparel and other gear. This committee will be a great opportunity
for Chapter, Lodge, and Section officers to gain hands-on budget experience. 


### Camping Promotions Committee

The Camping Promotions Committee, led
by Section W-1S Chief Jeremy Linch was created to aid in the promotion of camps
all over the Western Region. The members of this committee should have
knowledge of Cub Scout, Boy Scout, or Venturing Programs, and the desire to
help youth experience the outdoors at a Scout camp near them. Camp Staffing
experience is preferred, but not essential to be a member of this committee.
Committee members will use their communication skills, enthusiasm, and camping
experiences to promote camps within their area and help arrowmen get to camp.


### Communications Committee

The Communications Committee, led by Section W-1N Chief Kyle
McCaffery is tasked with engaging arrowmen in the Western Region using social
media, to create and deliver valuable content that is displayed on the Western
Region’s website, and to promote important information on social media
platform. The Communications Committee keeps arrowmen informed of region
events, leadership, training opportunities, and more. Members of this committee
should have good written communication skills, and a desire to promote the
awesome events happening within the Western Region
