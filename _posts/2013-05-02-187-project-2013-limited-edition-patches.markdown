<p><img src="images/posts/2013NationalJambo/NationalJambo4PatchSet.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Brothers,</p>
<p>Did you know that the Order of the Arrow Jamboree Service Group has created a special collection of the flaps representing all four divisions of the 2013 National Jamboree OA Staff? A limited number of these sets will be manufactured, with each set receiving a unique serial number. Orders will be accepted through June 1, 2013 for delivery during the week of July 15, 2013. Patch sets may be picked up at the National Jamboree, shipped to your home/business, or shipped with a personalized note as a gift from you to that special Arrowman.</p>
<p>The actual patch image will not be released until the start of the 2013 National Jamboree, at the OA Service Corps base operations.</p>
<p>Remember! This set will make a unique gift to help recognize a Scout's leadership in cheerful service to others. A personalized note from you can be included with your gift.</p>
<p>Order now at <a href="http://www.sgtradingpost.com/product.php?product_id=1102&amp;subcat_id=105">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.sgtradingpost.com/product.php?product_id=1102&amp;subcat_id=105">http://www.sgtradingpost.com/product.php?product_id=1102&amp;subcat_id=105</a>&nbsp;before its too late!</p>
