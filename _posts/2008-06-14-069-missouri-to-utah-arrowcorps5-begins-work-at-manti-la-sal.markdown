<img src=images/ac5marktwain4.jpg width=135 height=125 align=left style=padding-right:5px>The Order of the Arrow just completed the first of the ArrowCorps5 projects this summer at the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri. The site was a huge success; it exceeded expectations by clearing over 110 acres of the invasive cedar trees. Although the majority of the participants hailed from other regions, the West was represented by members of the InstructorsCorps (the crack team of Philmont staff traveling to every site) as well as a few staff and participants.
<br /><br />
The Manti-La-Sal project in Utah, the first in the West, is off and rolling. The Western Region is well represented in Utah, and further updates will follow. If Mark Twain is any indication, anyone who is lucky enough to participate in an ArrowCorps5 site this summer will be in for the experience of a lifetime.
