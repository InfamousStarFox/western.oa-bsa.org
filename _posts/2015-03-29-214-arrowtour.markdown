<p>4 months and counting. ArrowTour is now moving into the final stages of planning: and the 35 stop, 6 week tour will be coming to a city near you soon!</p>
<p>But what is ArrowTour? ArrowTour is an interactive event for Scouts, volunteers, and Scouting alumni that will travel throughout the country during the summer of 2015. The purpose of the tour is to commemorate the Order of the Arrow&rsquo;s 100th anniversary. During the event, guests will have the opportunity to Reflect, Connect, and Discover: Reflect on the history of the Order of the Arrow, Connect with other youth and adults in and out of their council, and Discover what the next 100 years of the Order can bring. We will be stopping at council camps, state capitols, and service centers to bring the OA to you. But we can't put everything in one article, so be sure to check out the Western Region ArrowTour at <a href="www.western.oa-bsa.org/ATWestern/" style="color: #000;">wwww.western.oa-bsa.org/ATWestern/</a>! You can read up about the full time crew, check out where the nearest stop to you is, and find out how you can help promote ArrowTour to your Section, Lodge, Council, or friends.</p>
