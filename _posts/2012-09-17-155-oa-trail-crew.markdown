<p><a href="http://adventure.oa-bsa.org/index.php?p=trailcrew" target="_blank"><img src="images/philmont.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Philmont Logo - Click for more info on OA Trail Crew"></a>The Order of the Arrow is offering you an opportunity to join other Arrowmen 
  in cheerful service and the formation of lasting brotherhood on the trails of 
  Philmont Scout Ranch. Under the direction of the Philmont Conservation Department, 
  experienced Philmont staff members with strong Order of the Arrow backgrounds 
  will lead participants on the two week trail crew and trek. </p>
<p>The program is a fourteen day experience. The first week focuses on trail construction 
  and maintenance under the guidance of Philmont trail crew foremen. The second 
  week is a seven day backpacking trek that is designed by the participants. The 
  program is not simply building trail and hiking though, the OA Trail Crew is 
  ultimately a journey that challenges Scouts mentally, physically, and spiritually.</p>
<p>Trail building is tough. The worksite experience is full of long, strenuous 
  days requiring a great deal of physical effort. Participants are expected to 
  work with great diligence as the trail that is being built is designed to last 
  over 75 years and protect the beautiful landscape of Philmont Scout Ranch. Other 
  than trail building techniques, Scouts will strengthen their leadership skills, 
  learn advanced wilderness and low-impact camping skills, observe and participate 
  in group wilderness safety, good judgment, and motivation activities, and receive 
  special OA instruction.</p>
<p>The project's mission is to maintain, reinforce, and enhance the purpose of 
  the Order of the Arrow by using Scout camping traditions. Participants are expected 
  to use their experience to benefit their troop, chapter, lodge and council programs. 
  Camping is a method of Scouting that enhances and builds stronger programs and 
  people.</p>
