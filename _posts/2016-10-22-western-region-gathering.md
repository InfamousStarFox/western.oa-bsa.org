From October 21-23, section chiefs, advisers and staff advisers will descend upon Irvine Ranch Outdoor Education Center in Orange, CA for the annual Western Region Gathering.<!--more-->
During this retreat, several workshops will be held to help section chiefs and advisers improve their sections and lodges back home, as well as providing training to ensure that a quality program is presented.  These include sessions like "How to support your lodges" and "OAHA promotions though your section".

2016 Region Chief Joe Garcia says his goal is to help incoming section chiefs prepare for their job by asking the question "I'm the chief - Now what?" and these sessions will help achieve that goal.
"We will be having multiple workshops that give the chiefs the opportunity to take the leadership skills they have learned and apply them to their incoming year," says Garcia. "Earlier this year, I asked the chiefs serving at that time what questions they had when they were elected, and what wasn't clear to them when they headed to the National Planning Meeting in Dallas, and their feedback helped me plan the sessions for the Region Gathering."
Also attending the event will be members of the Western Region Committee and National Committee.
