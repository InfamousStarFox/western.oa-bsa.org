Last month section chiefs and key NOAC staff from across the nation descended on Dallas, Texas to kick-start the planning and preparation for this summerâ€™s conference. To facilitate this process NOAC planning was delegated to eleven committees, each responsible for a specific aspect of the conference (much like a conclave is normally planned by various committees). To provide leadership to the committees, eleven section chiefs were elected to serve as conference vice chiefs. Five of the 2009 conference vice chiefs hail from the Western Region:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Jack Chinn, Training</li>
<li>Dylan Ellsworth, Chiefs Corps</li>
<li>Freddy Gross, Outdoor Adventure</li>
<li>Jake Knudsen, The Experience</li>
<li>Robert Lukoviak, Founderâ€™s Day</li>
</ul>
Serving as a CVC for a national conference is a tremendous honor, but also comes with significant responsibility and service. More than 7,000 Arrowmen are expected to travel from all around the world to attend the conference in Indiana this summer, and all come with high expectations. These CVCs, along with all of the other Western Region section chiefs who took on key roles within the eleven committees, are tasked with delivering a quality experience for every NOAC participant.
<br/><br/>
We would like to congratulate the five Western Region section chiefs who were elected to lead a committee, and wish the best of luck to all of the Western Region section chiefs as you provide leadership to one of the largest, most anticipated events in the history of the Order.
