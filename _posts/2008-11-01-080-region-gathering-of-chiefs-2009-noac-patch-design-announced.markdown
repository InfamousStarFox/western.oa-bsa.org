The leadership of the Western Region descended upon the Heard Scout Pueblo in Phoenix, Arizona for the annual Gathering of Chiefs the weekend of October 24-26. This event was an opportunity for the chiefs to get to know and learn from each other, as well as a chance for the Region to set its direction for the next year.
<br/><br/>
The weekend started off with a trip to the local minor-league hockey game, the Phoenix Road Runners, as a team-building experience. Not only did the Chiefs get free foam fingers, but they were able to grow in unity as a leadership team. Saturday was spent in intense breakout sessions, covering topics including the Lodge Assistance Program, Quality Lodge attainment, and NOAC promotion, among others. The weekend concluded with an 80th birthday celebration for past Region Chairman and National Committee Member, Del Loder.

The Gathering also included the first Region Council of Chiefs, in which all of the section chiefs called their lodge chiefs and discussed some important information. Following this, the section chiefs convened and voted on behalf of all of the lodges in the region. The most important outcome of the RCOC was the NOAC patch design for the region, pictured above. The patch is already in the process of being ordered, and will be available for purchase shortly. The other patch designs that were submitted in the contest can be seen <a href=http://western.oa-bsa.org/leadership/patchcontest/>here</a>.
