But every now and then, a Lodge goes far beyond their call of duty and preforms services greater than that expected of a Lodge.

T’Kope Kwiskwis Lodge in Seattle, WA has spent the last three years organizing a follow-up to the very successful Arrowcorps5 within their Lodge. "After seeing the success of the ArrowCorps5 projects in 2008, rangers from both agencies started asking us why there was no such project here in the Pacific Northwest" said Ian Bellows, one of the project organizers from the lodge.

From August 3-9, 2014, Scouts from around the nation will again converge on Mt. Rainier for a week of brotherhood, cheerfulness and service. Based at Camp Sheppard in the shadow of the mountain, trail crews will complete a variety of projects under the direction of land management personnel and skilled youth and adult leaders. Participants will have the chance to learn expedition leadership, trail skills, and wilderness ethics while immersing themselves in the story of our national public lands. This exciting opportunity is open to all Arrowmen, Boy Scouts, and Venturers meeting criteria for participation in high adventure activities. From the earliest Eagle Scout trail crew projects in 1925 in to the projects of today, ArrowCorps2014 continues the rich legacy of Scout service in one of America’s most iconic places.

This project does much more than just provide some great service to our National Parks though. "We’ve found that participants working together in an outdoor setting gain self-confidence and leadership experience they can’t find anywhere else" explained Bellows. "They come back better prepared to lead themselves and others in their families, schools, and communities."
