The weekend consisted of the usual conclave training and fellowship activities, but also featured SCUBA BSA and Redwood Empire Council's climbing wall at the midway--and next to the wall was a CHP Officer who was instructed to do nothing more than 'Go to Two Rock.'  The American Indian Affairs activities were a crowd favorite, as well as the sno-cone machine, but those Arrowmen who were bold enough to adventure near the CHP Officer and the climbing wall had a great time.
