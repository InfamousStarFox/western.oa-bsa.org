It was a weekend of training, fellowship, adventure.  Highlights include the four hour simulated conclave training the the youth participated in, as well as the mandatory recreational activities (an Advisers v. Officers water balloon fight, a 100 feet long slip and slide, and a water slide).<p>
The most interesting training of the weekend was 2010 Western Region Chief Fred Gross' training that encouraged Section to 'break the mold' and explore new options for their Conclaves.  The results of the training exercise can be found in PDF by <a href=http://western.oa-bsa.org/resources/breaking_the_mold.pdf>clicking this link.</a><p>
