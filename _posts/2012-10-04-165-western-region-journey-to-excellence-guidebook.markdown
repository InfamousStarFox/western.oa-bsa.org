<p>Brothers of the Western Region,<img src="{{site.baseurl}}images/Resources/WestIsBest.jpg" width="118" height="153" alt="WestIsBest" style="float: right;" /></p>
<p>In concurrence with the change from Quality Lodge to Journey to Excellence, the Western Region started an initiative to create a guidebook to help our lodges in the West to successfully navigate the waters of the daunting JTE requirements.</p>
<p>A regional committee, chaired by Section W6W chief Sam Bellomy, set out to develop a guidebook that will specifically aid the lodges of the West, which we know are much different from the rest of the nation. We understand that the lodges of the West have different issues and concerns than the lodges of the other regions, and therefore wanted to create a replacement for the Western Region's Quality Lodge Handbook.</p>
<p>I am proud to announce the completion of this initiative, and the release of the new guidebook!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The First Edition of the&nbsp;<a href="resources/jte">Western Region Journey to Excellence Guidebook and the Western Region Backdating Calendar</a> is available now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Guidebook and calendar will hopefully be helpful to your lodges as you begin your planning for next year and in the future.</p>
<p>Sam Bellomy, Mike Bliss, the Region Committee, and myself are all proud to bring you these documents. As well, while you are using these documents, please send us any questions, comments, or revisions. You may send those straight to Sam Bellomy, <a href="mailto:sam.bellomy@gmail.com.">sam.bellomy@gmail.com.</a></p>
<p>Thank you all for your dedication to our Order and to the Arrowmen of the best Region! We hope these resources are helpful, and any feedback is welcomed!</p>
<p>Chiefs, Lodge Advisers, and Staff Advisers: Please distribute to your Lodge Chiefs, LECs, Section, etc. We need your help in spreading our new resources!</p>
<p>Remember, West is always Best!</p>
<p>Yours in Brotherhood, Cheerfulness, and Service,</p>
<p>Joe Barton<br />2012 WR Chief</p>
