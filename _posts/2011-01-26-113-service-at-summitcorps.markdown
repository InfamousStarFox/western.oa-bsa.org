<p>The summer of 2008 was by far the most fun I have had in one summer so far in my life.  This was not because I made the transition from a high school student to a college student, it was not because I turned eighteen, it was because of the amazing experience I had at the Shasta-Trinity site of ArrowCorps5.</p>
<p>I never intended to attend ArrowCorps5.  I sat through Chapter meeting after Chapter meeting ignoring the urgings of our contingent leader that I ought to attend.  It was only after a member unfortunately dropped out of our Lodge contingent two months before the event that I decided to attend ArrowCorps5.  I was glad I did.</p>
<p>National events such as ArrowCorps5 and SummitCorps give us as Arrowmen the wonderful opportunity to be able to serve in capacities that we normally would not be able to in our day-to-day routine.  The average person does not have the opportunity to wander around beautiful forests and make those wonderful groves of trees accessible for more people to enjoy.</p>
<p>SummitCorps gives us the opportunity to do this to the New River Gorge National River.  This is your one opportunity to be able to partake of the joys of service in this fashion on this land.  I encourage each and every Arrowman to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity.

<p>Yours in Service,<br>
Michael Millerick<br>
2010 Section W3N Secretary</p>
