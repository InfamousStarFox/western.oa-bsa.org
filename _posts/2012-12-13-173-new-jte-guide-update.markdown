<p>In celebration of our upcoming JTE year, the Western Region has made some updates to the <a class="doclink" href="index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=28&amp;Itemid=262">Western Region Journey To Excellence Guidebook</a>&nbsp;released earlier this year. This revised edition has corrections to the old document as well as some new content to give you the best possible experience with the new JTE program. We at the Western Region wish you good luck with JTE 2013 and want to remind you that West is Best!!!</p>
