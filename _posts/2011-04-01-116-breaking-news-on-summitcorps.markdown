Arrowmen,

JUST ARRIVED! BREAKING NEWS ON SUMMITCORPS <br>

<p>
Attention SummitCorps contingent leaders and participants! The <i>2011 SummitCorps Contingent Leader and Participant Guide</i> is now posted on the <a href=http://www.event.oa-bsa.org>National OA Events website</a>. This Guide contains all the important information that you need to know before attending the 2011 SummitCorps including medical information, transportation, administrative items, and a personal needs list.
<p>
Also, individual registration is now available through <a href=https://registration.oabsa.org>the OA Registration website</a>. All participants are encouraged to register online as part of their lodge contingent by May 1, 2011. Final payment for participation is due by May 1, 2011. Lodge contingents are asked to submit the final fees using the transmittal found in the contingent leader section of the registration website.
<p>
There are still spots available! The caps originally in place for lodge participation were lifted earlier this year. There are over 400 spots still available for SummitCorps. Spread the word to encourage others to join us in West Virginia this summer for any of the four weeks!
<p>
Finally, over the upcoming months, we will share additional information with you on the project, recreation activities and program through News You Can Use. We look forward to seeing you at SummitCorps!

Yours in Service,<br>
