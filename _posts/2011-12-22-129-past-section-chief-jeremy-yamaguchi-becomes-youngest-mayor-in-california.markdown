<b>PLACENTIA -</b> Eagle Scout, Past Section W4B Chief, California State University Fullerton student, and Placentia 
City Councilman Jeremy Yamaguchi was named as the mayor of Placentia on Dec. 6 at a Placentia City Council 
meeting.<p>
Yamaguchi is the youngest mayor in Orange County history and the youngest serving mayor in the state of California. 
At the age of 22, he has served as a City Council member for three years, a director for the Orange County Fire 
Authority, and the founding chairman for the Placentia Community Foundation. 
In November 2008, Yamaguchi was elected to the City Council at the age of 19 for a term of four years. In a race with 
six candidates for three open seats, he received the highest total vote count, nearly 30 percent higher than the sitting 
mayor. <p>
Yamaguchi earned his Eagle Scout award in 2006 and was chosen in 2007 as the California Scout of the Year by the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 2008, he served as the Lodge Chief and a board member for the Orange County Council. 
As Lodge Chief, he led Boy Scouts throughout the county to garner in excess of 20,000 community service hours.  
He continues to volunteer in the scouting program as an Assistant Scoutmaster for his troop in Placentia and  as the 
Associate Lodge Advisor in Wiatava Lodge. <p>
Yamaguchi graduated from Placentia's El Dorado High School in 2007 with numerous honors and distinctions, 
including a historic record of 3,000 community service hours. He is currently a senior at California State University 
Fullerton majoring in political science with a minor in music. His last final is on Friday.  On campus, Yamaguchi is 
a member of the Pi Sigma Alpha Political Science Honor Society, the CSUF pre-law society, Golden-Key, and the Phi 
Beta Delta honor society for international scholars.  He hopes to continue his education to obtain a master's degree 
in public administration and a juris doctorate in order to study and practice law. <p>
Congratulations Jeremy, the Order of the Arrow wishes you much continued success in the years to come.
