<b>Overview</b></p>

<p>The World Scout Jamboree (WSJ) is held every four years and this will be the first WSJ with an OA contingent.  The event will bring 40,000 Scouts from 114 countries together to share international friendship and provide adventure for personal growth and development.  Imagine camping next to a Scout unit from Poland, eating lunch with Scouts from Chile, trading uniforms and insignia with Scouts from Greece, and playing games with Scouts from Thailand.  The possibilities are endless and the memories are forever!</p>

<p>The theme for the 2011 WSJ is "Simply Scouting" which will focus on camping and basic scouting skills.  The Order is Scouting's National Honor Society and is rooted in the outdoors.  The theme of the event will be a great opportunity to showcase the Order.</p>

<p>In order to attend this event as a Scout, you must have been born between July 25, 1993 and July 27, 1997, no exceptions.</p>

<p><b>OA Contingent</b></p>

<p>The Western Region will be sending several troops to the WSJ based on geographic location.  Scouts from neighboring councils will join together in representing the BSA to the world.  This jamboree will include an opportunity for Western Region Arrowmen to attend the event as one unit!  As part of the unit, Scouts will have the opportunity to develop region wide brotherhood, participate in leadership development and share ideas to strengthen the region.</p>
