The newly formed Communications and Technology Committee is a group of youth volunteers and adult advisers, along with section secretaries that choose to join the team. The goal of the committee is to engage arrowmen in the Western Region using social media and to create and deliver valuable content that is delivered on the Western Region's website, which is in turn promoted on social media platforms to keep arrowmen informed of region events, leadership, training opportunities, and more.

The tech team is led by Section W-1N Chief, Kyle McCaffery in WA. It is his goal to upgrade the technological aspects of the Western Region communications so that anyone, regardless of their technological abilities will be able to post engaging content without delay. This includes giving section secretaries the ability to update their section and lodge rosters, allowing for instantly updated rosters following elections. Implement subscription based emails about current content and news stories, and provide a uniform standard across all of our mediums: social media, emails, website, and print.

The media team is led by youth volunteer Eric Wagstaff from Section W-1S in Portland, OR. Eric’s goal is to establish a solid Media Team made up of youth from around the region with a focus on a re-energizing our presence on the region’s newly designed website and social media accounts. He and his team will provide viewers with entertaining and informative posts on our social media accounts while simultaneously posting the same content on our website to maximize views and interactions. Keeping viewers engaged and in tune with what is going on all over the region is going to be his team’s focus for the coming year.

The Committee is advised by Brian Love, recently relocated to Denver, CO from the Northeast Region. For 2016 his goal was to re-establish the committee by creating two new teams of youth and adult volunteers: a media team and a technology team. Further, we developed a new platform for distributed contributions to the region website using GitHub. This enabled our team of youth and adults to build and launch a new website that is mobile-first, responsive, and high performing. With our new platform and website in place, our goal for the rest of 2016 and into 2017 is to generate content, create engaging stories and promote the Western Region on social media.
