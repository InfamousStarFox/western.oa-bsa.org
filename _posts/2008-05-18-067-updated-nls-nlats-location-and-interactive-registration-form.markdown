<img src=images/nls_form.jpg  style=padding-left: 5px; align=right border=0 height=100 width=133><p>The location for the <a href="/program/training/nls.php">National Leadership Seminar (NLS)</a> scheduled for November 14-16, 2008 will be held at the Coast Guard Station at Alameda. As Coast Guard Island is an active military base, all staff and participants must be pre-registered and bring some form of photo identification (driver's license, student ID). All drivers are required to provide registration and proof of insurance to enter the base.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Western Region has added a new <a href="/program/training/nlats.php">National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS)</a> program, contingent on minimum registration goals, to coincide with the same NLS program in November.</p>

<p>The registration form for <a href="/program/training/nls.php#form">NLS/NLATS</a> is now interactive to help make the registration process even easier for participants. This means that participants can now type their information directly into the form before printing. All entry fields are highlighted for ease of visibility, and, since it's digital, participants can save a copy of the form on their computer to print later if needed.</p>
