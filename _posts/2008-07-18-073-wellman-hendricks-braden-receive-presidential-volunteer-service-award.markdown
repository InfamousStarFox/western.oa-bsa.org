On a surprise visit to Redding, California, President George W. Bush presented Order of the Arrow National Chief Jake Wellman, Western Region Chief Mark Hendricks, and Youth Incident Commander for the Shasta-Trinity project Alex Braden with the Presidentâ€™s Volunteer Service Award on Thursday, July 17, 2008.
<br/><br/>
â€œThis recognition is a strong testament to the incredible work Arrowmen have been doing all summer long and the impact we have already made on America,â€ said Wellman, â€œWest is Best!â€
<br/><br/>
The Volunteer Service Award was presented to the three leaders for their influential role in ArrowCorps5 â€“ the largest service project the Order of the Arrow has ever undertaken. Over the course of 5 weeks in the summer of 2008, nearly 5,000 Arrowmen from across the nation will provide more than 250,000 hours of volunteer service to our National Forests.
<br/><br/>
The Presidentâ€™s Volunteer Service Award was created at the Presidentâ€™s direction by the Presidentâ€™s Council on Service and Civic Participation.  The Award is available to youth ages 14 and under who have completed 50 or more hours of volunteer service; to individuals 15 and older who have completed 100 or more hours; and to families or groups who have completed 200 or more hours.
