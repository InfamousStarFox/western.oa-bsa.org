The first Region Council of Chiefs will be held October 25th, 2008, at 3:00 p.m. mountain standard time (<a href='http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=10&day=25&year=2008&hour=15&min=0&sec=0&p1=197' target='_blank'>click for time in your area</a>). This event will enable lodges in the West to have a voice in the decisions made by the region, including the selection of the Regionâ€™s 2009 NOAC patch design. Each section chief in the region will be calling their respective lodge chiefs (or their designee) during this time frame to conduct a poll. The results of the Region NOAC Patch Design Contest will be tallied and the winner announced. Please make plans with your section chief to be available during this time slot.
<br/><br/>
Make every lodgesâ€™ voice count: help ensure 100% participation in the first RCOC!
