  The Western Region of the Order of the Arrow has been affected by the recently 
  announced plan by the Western Region BSA to reorganize councils into new geographic 
  areas. This is a very exciting time for the Region as this reorganization will 
  allow us to better serve the Boy Scout program. <br/>
  <br/>
  The Region has experienced many changes, but the region and section leadership is 
  ensuring that everything transitions as smoothly as possible.<br/>
  <br/>
  The most noticeable of these changes is the realignment of our current areas 
  and sections across the region. Every section except for one will experience 
  change. Some sections will lose lodges and some will gain; for some these changes 
  will be small, and for others the changes will be very significant. After the 
  realignment we will increase the total number of sections from 12 to 14 which 
  will be contained within 6 physical Areas rather than 4 previously. <br/>
  <br/>
  The following changes are <b>effective immediately</b> for sections which have 
  completed their 2008 conclave.</p>

<p><b><i>Please note that the section designations used above are temporary and 
  will be replaced with permanent designations in the near future.</i></b></p>
<p>Because sections are being realigned, the section leadership will need to adapt 
  to these changes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Section officers will serve in the position in which they were elected in 
    the new section that their home OA lodge is assigned. Their term of office 
    will be until the next conclave.</li>
  <li>Sections that still need to complete their 2008 Conclave will proceed as 
    planned with conclave. This includes normal elections with all current lodges 
    participating. Youth from any lodge in the current section may run for office 
    regardless of the status of their lodge at the end of the conclave. However, 
    no youth shall use the reorganization as part of his platform for office and 
    it is the responsibility of the Section adviser to ensure adherence to this 
    policy. At no time should the reorganization remove the opportunity for a 
    youth to run for office or vote as provided in the Field Operations Guide.</li>
  <li>A special Council of Chiefs with appropriate advance notice will be held 
    to elect officers for any vacant offices which may be caused by the reorganization. 
    The process will be similar to filling a vacancy caused by election to a National 
    office as provided by the Field Operations Guide. All elected Section Chiefs 
    (through conclave election or the Council of Chiefs election) will be invited 
    to Texas, may run for national office, and serve on a NOAC committee.</li>
  <li>In some cases sections will have co-chiefs, co-vice chiefs, and/or co-secretaries. 
    They will share the duties in that capacity until the 2009 Section Conclave 
    of the new sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section Advisers and Section Staff Advisers will be appointed by the Area Directors 
  in consultation with and concurrence by the Region OA Chairman and the Region 
  OA Staff Adviser.</p>
<p>A listing of the Section Chiefs following realignment and newly appointed advisers 
  is listed below. It is the responsibility of the chief and adviser to confirm 
  current vice chief(s) and secretary(s) in a given section.<br />
