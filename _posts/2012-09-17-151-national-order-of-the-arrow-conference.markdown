<p>Every two years, Arrowmen from across the country gather on the campus of a major university for the National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC).</p>
<p>The National Order of the Arrow Conference is Scouting's second-largest national program event. The reason for its growing popularity can be attributed to the fact that it is planned and carried out by Arrowmen themselves. Youth involvement ensures that the conference program will be exciting, relevant, and non-stop fun.</p>
<p>These gatherings draw over 7000 Arrowmen, traveling from as far away as Europe and Asia, for five days of training, fun, and fellowship. With each conference, NOAC becomes more diversified, more fun, and more exciting.</p>
<p>NOAC has many different aspects and it is impossible to participate in every event in one year. Each year events are added and changed so you could go to NOAC every time and do new things each time. The main activities at NOAC include training, ceremonies evaluation, American Indian events, shows, competitions, and Founder's Day. NOAC has something for everyone of all backgrounds and all ages. It is definitely one of Scouting's most unique and entertaining training events.</p>
