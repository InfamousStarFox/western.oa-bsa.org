<p><img src="images/oaoa.jpg" alt="OA Ocean Adventure" align="right" border=0 width=250 height=188>The Order of the Arrow, in cooperation with the Florida Sea Base, is offering Arrowmen an opportunity to cheerfully serve the greatest ecosystem on our planet--the ocean. Under the direction of the National Marine Sanctuary and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), experienced Florida Sea Base staff with strong Order of the Arrow backgrounds will lead participants on a two week scuba diving adventure in the beautiful waters of the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>The program is a 13 day experience in which participants will have the opportunity to explore and serve the undersea world. One-half of the Ocean Adventure program will be PADI SCUBA training and certification, which will be held at the Florida Sea Base. The remaining portion of the program will focus on rendering cheerful service to the ocean marine life and coral reefs of the Florida Keys.</p>
<p>PADI SCUBA certification requires a significant amount of independent study, which will need to be completed prior to arrival at the Florida Sea Base. The service will consist of a variety of projects, as defined by the National Marine Sanctuary and NOAA, some of which will be underwater cleaning or monitoring projects. In addition to SCUBA certification and undersea service, participants will strengthen leadership skills, learn more about marine environments, strengthen understanding of the Order of the Arrow, and explore the history of the beautiful Florida Keys.</p>
<p>Participant cost is $250 for the 13 day experience. A $50 non-refundable deposit is required with the application. The balance of the fee is due at the time of acceptance as a participant in the program. This cost covers PADI SCUBA certification, food, housing, and all other program related expenses. Additional expenses, including travel to and from Sea Base as well as miscellaneous purchases, are the responsibility of the participant.</p>
