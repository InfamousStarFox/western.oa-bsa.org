The 2016 Section W-1S took place in September at Antique Powerland Historical Park in Salem, Oregon. We were joined by Hunter Scott, 2016 National Chief, Trip Jackson, W-1N Chief, Kyle McCaffrey, W-1N Secretary, and Nathan Lee 2015 Western Region Chief.

Our event kicked off with an awesome opening show on Friday night featuring lodge adviser lip-sync battles and videos with members of our section singing and entertaining us all. 
After breakfast on Saturday morning the over 500 attendees had 55 unique training sessions to choose from. Topics like using pyrotechnics in ceremonies, preparing for a Philmont trek, and blacksmithing.

Saturday afternoon participants had the opportunity to take part in awesome activities such as archery, bounce houses, and a fully functional Native American Village. All throughout the day unlimited cotton candy, popcorn, and ice cream were available free of charge!

Before the closing show, National Chief Hunter Jones ran the section officer elections. Jeremy Linch was elected as Section Chief, David Mudd as Section Vice-Chief, and Jordan Jefferis as Section Secretary. Congratulations gentlemen!

Our final show on Saturday night was amazing, showcasing the screenwriting and acting talents of our lodge members! Add to that the opportunity to throw pies in the faces of our lodge chiefs and everyone had a great time.

When Sunday morning dawned it was time to clean up Powerland site. As always, Arrowmen worked diligently to leave activity areas cleaner than when we found them. After a wrap up meeting with the conclave committee, it was time for all scouts to say goodbye and head home from one of the most successful Conclaves ever hosted by section W-1S.

Section W-1S would also like to thank outgoing Chief Matthew Shumway, Adviser Roy Walter, and all the Conclave Vice-Chiefs for an outstanding Conclave and a great year in our section! Thank you all for your devoted service to our Order.

Plans for Conclave 2017 are already in the works. Mark your calendars for September 8-10, 2017 at Lane Community College in Eugene. Hope to see you there!

Ashton Mills,
2015-2016 W-1S Section Secretary
