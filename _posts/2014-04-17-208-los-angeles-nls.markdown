<p>Last weekend Arrowmen from across California and the Western Region joined together at Forest Lawn Scout Reservation for the first Western Region National Leadership Seminar of 2014!</p>
<p>NLS is the Order of the Arrow&rsquo;s top leadership training. Over the weekend, Arrowmen learned over 20 different leadership tricks (as well as countless other tips from their trainers and table guides) to help them be better leaders both in the Order and beyond.</p>
<p>The National Leadership Seminar is always full of surprises. From inspiring presentations to the craziness of the Game of Life, it is a great chance for Arrowmen to see onward and upward to new levels of leadership. Table groups are formed by scrambling members from different lodges so everyone is able to meet new people and learn different ideas from across the OA.</p>
<p>And this NLS was one of the best ones ever! With some of the tallest paper towers, best role plays, and awesome discussions, this group took full advantage of the region training staff to learn as much as they could about leadership!</p>
<p>In the end, NLS is all about what you take home! Perhaps the most impressive part of this NLS were some of the lofty goals the Arrowmen hope to achieve.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t been to a National Leadership Seminar, there are still two more this year! Check out <strong>NLS: Philmont</strong> in September or <strong>NLS: San Fran</strong> in November! Details are at http:// western.oa-bsa.org/program/training/nls</p>
