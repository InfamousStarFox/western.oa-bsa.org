<h2>We interviewed Chief Nick Dannemiller and Vice Chief Taylor Bobrow</h2>
<h3>2014 National Vice Chief Taylor Bobrow:</h3>
<h4>1) What do you hope to be doing in 10 years?</h4>
<p>"I hope to be an electrical engineer designing solutions that improve the lives of people around the world."</p>
<h4>2) What are some of your biggest goals for your term?</h4>
<p>"I will be focused on working with initiatives that will support our Units, Chapters, and Lodges, as well as our training programs, that will better equip our leaders with tools that will help make them successful."</p>
<h4>3) Name a famous or well­known individual that you look up to and respect? Why?</h4>
<p>"I respect the work of Steve Jobs and his innovation with Apple because he has influenced my focuses as an engineer."</p>
<h4>4) Give us some advice for aspiring Arrowmen in the Western Region.</h4>
<p>"Don't settle for the norm. Think big, go crazy, and try something new and innovative. This attitude, coupled with determination, has served me well."</p>
<h4>5) What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done in the OA/Scouting?</h4>
<p>"4 years of camp staff by far. I have always had a lot of respect for camp staff, and attribute some of my greatest memories to all of the fun had there."</p>
<h4>6) If you could be any restaurant dish, which dish would you be, and who would you want to be served to?</h4>
<p>"I would be lasagna, because it is delicious, and I would be served to Neil Peart, my favorite drummer from the band Rush."</p>
<h3>2014 National Chief Nick Dannemiller</h3>
<h4>1) What do you hope to be doing in 10 years?</h4>
<p>"I hope to be practicing as a wildlife or exotic veterinarian either with a federal/state agency or with a zoo/aquarium. I really enjoy animals, medicine, and humans and figured this would be a great way to find a balance between all three. However, secretly I must admit that I hope to become a professional “Hey”­er in some alternative or indie band. Just think of your favorite alternative song and if you listen closer you have someone or a group people who just yell, 'Hey' or 'Ho' in the case of The Lumineers."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2) What are some of your biggest goals for your term?</h4>
<p>"This is an exciting year in the fact that Taylor and I get to help plan the Centennial Celebration [of the Order of the Arrow]. That being said, my major priorities are ensuring the successful delivery of ArrowTour and the National Day of Service. On top of that I want to help put together the framework for the key program elements of our National Order of the Arrow Conference happening next summer and begin laying the groundwork for the 2016 national event. If that wasn’t enough, I would also like to foster our five excellent OA High Adventure programs and really get to know Arrowmen from all across the country. Lower on the totem pole, but still something I would love to accomplish, is to grace the inside of a Waffle House and enjoy one of its iconic meals."</p>
<h4>3) Name a famous or well­known individual that you look up to and respect? Why?</h4>
<p>"I really look up to Steve Prefontaine. Not only is he from Oregon (shameless plug for the best state in the union) and one of the greatest athletes of all time, but he was also an incredibly humble and kind man. It’s amazing to imagine being so good at something and still being modest and encouraging to those who are trying to succeed. My favorite quote by him is, “To give anything less than your best, is to sacrifice the gift.”</p>
<h4>4) Give us some advice for aspiring Arrowmen in the Western Region.</h4>
<p>"The bottom line is you (yes you reading this) having just as much impact on the success of the Order as I do. We each have a responsibility to help fulfill the mission and purposes in our Scouting involvement and everyday life. By taking the time to find something you are passionate about in this organization, and working to help continuingly improve it, can change everything. If every Arrowmen did this next year, we could see an incredible year of growth on every level of this brotherhood."</p>
<h4>5) What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done in the OA/Scouting?</h4>
<p>"During the last few months as my term as lodge chief, I had the opportunity to rappel down one of the tallest buildings in Portland. It was part of an event called Over the Edge and it served as a fundraiser for my council. While I’m not afraid of heights, it’s a crazy feeling to lean out over the edge of such a tall building and began to descend (the brain not surprisingly resists the urge). The entire descent offered great views of Bridgetown and was an amazing rush that I will certainly not forget."</p>
<h4>6) If you could be any restaurant dish, which dish would you be, and whom would you want to be served to?</h4>
<p>"After not much thought, I would have to say I would be served as sushi ­ in particular some type of crazy roll. This is because a) I love sushi and b) I think it would be cool to be something different and worldly. Plus, I would include wasabi and ginger as part of me/the dish because it adds kick like me. As far as who to be served to, it would have to be a tie between Jennifer Lawrence and John Stewart for obvious reasons."</p>
