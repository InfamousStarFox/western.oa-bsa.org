  Gathering of Chiefs</font></p>
<p>Each year the section chiefs of the Western Region gather for a weekend in 
  Phoenix, Arizona. During this time, they have the opportunity to build their 
  leadership skills and learn how to effectively promote and execute the program 
  of the Order of the Arrow within their home sections and lodges. The chiefs 
  spend the weekend in fellowship with each other and grow as a team of the key 
  leadership of the region. Idea sharing between all in attendance is a main objective 
  of the weekend, with an emphasis on program enhancement and goal setting. In 
  addition to the section chiefs, the region chief and another national officer 
  are in attendance, as well as section and region advisers and several National 
  Committeemen.</p>
<p>The 2012 Gathering of Chiefs will be held <b>October 26-28, 2012</b> in <b>Phoenix, Arizona</b>.</p>
