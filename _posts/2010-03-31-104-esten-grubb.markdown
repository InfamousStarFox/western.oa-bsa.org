The Western region has lost a great Arrowmen. It is with great sadness for so many members of the Boy Scouts of America of which he was a proud and dedicated member for 75 years, and the literally thousands of boys whose futures he found it his calling to help shape over those many decades, that we note Esten passed peacefully and humbly after a very brief illness in the Whittier, California home which he shared with his beloved Midge (Gloria) for over 58 of their 63 years of marriage. Gloria and his two sons, Travis and Tim were with him as he began his "adventure" to see what's "on the other side". It was a "quest" of which he spoke often, contemplated for several years, and now no doubt, pursues with the vigor of a new life and a freshly pressed Boy Scout uniform, compass in hand.
