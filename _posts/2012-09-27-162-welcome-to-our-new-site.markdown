<p>Welcome to the New Western Region Website!</p>
<p>The web team has worked long hours to put this new site together, and I would like to personally thank Mr. Rob Rosamond for all the hard work he has put into the new website. Without his help, this site could not have been launched.</p>
<p>The web team has made this site with the completey new Joomla! program and new servers with the goal of creating an easily navigatable wesbsite for everyone from new Arrowmen to Section Chiefs. Some major improvements have been made to the site, including, but not limited to, the Calendar page, the Resources page, and the social media quick links on the right. We are still working on making this site the best it has ever been, and we would like your input on how to get it right! If you have any recommendations or comments on the new site please send them to me using the link below.</p>
<p>Thank you for your input and we hope you enjoy the new site!</p>
<p>Don't forget to&nbsp;<a href="index.php?option=com_contact&amp;view=contact&amp;catid=14:contact&amp;id=25-zackary-crosley&amp;Itemid=268" target="_blank">EMAIL US!!!</a></p>
