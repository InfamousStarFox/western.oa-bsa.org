The first three ArrowCorps5 sites have all been a resounding success, and each have exceeded the expectations of the Order of the Arrow and the US Forest Service. Everyone involved has had a great time, and we expect the next two sites (Shasta-Trinity and Bridger-Teton - both in the West) to be just as successful.
<br /><br />
The first three sites have all received significant local and regional media coverage - which is awesome. We can take it to the next level and get national coverage at Shasta, but <b>we need your help</b>. If you have any personal stories about youth Arrowmen who will be at Shasta, maybe stories about significant hardship in becoming Scouts, Arrowmen, or getting to Shasta, or just about really cool people that deserve recognition, please <a href=http://western.oa-bsa.org/contact/?MailTo=Region%20Chief%20(Mark%20Hendricks)>contact us</a> ASAP. If you're not sure if the story is worthwhile, respond anyways. Just give a brief summary of the Arrowman's story, and your contact info, and we'll follow up.
<br /><br />
The OA is attempting to set an example for the rest of the nation regarding conservation and youth involvement in our national resources, and the media is probably our best method of telling our story. Please help!
<br /><br />
If you have a story to share, please <a href=http://western.oa-bsa.org/contact/?MailTo=Region%20Chief%20(Mark%20Hendricks)>let us know</a> ASAP.
