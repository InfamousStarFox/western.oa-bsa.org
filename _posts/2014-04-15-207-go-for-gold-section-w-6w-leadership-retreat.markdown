<p>The Section W-6W leadership met on March 21-23, 2014 for their annual Section Leadership 
Retreat (SLR) at Camp Fiesta Island in sunny San Diego, California. The SLR is a fun-filled 
weekend where the section leadership comes together for Conclave planning, training, and 
team bonding. This year’s theme for the SLR was “Go For Gold.” Inspired by the recent winter 
olympics, participants learned of the necessary skills and tools to effectively come together 
as a team to pull off a successful conclave. Firday night was filled with ice breakers, which 
allowed everyone in attendance to better know each other. The next day, is down to business 
with training sessions, site presentations, meetings, and team building. Training sessions 
emphasized the importance of good communication, the Seven Ps (Prior Proper Planning 
Prevents Pitifully Poor Performance), the essentials of the Journey To Excellence program, 
usage of different media, and much more. By the time afternoon rolled around, participants 
had the opportunity to take advantage of the aquatic activities that were present at the facility. 
Canoe races allowed the participants to clear their minds and to further build the bonds of 
a cohesive team. In the evening, participants were treated to some fireworks from the local 
Seaworld, followed by more fellowship. On the last day, participants took part in the last of the 
training sessions before setting out for home. Amongst the laughter, fellowship, meetings, and 
training sessions, a team was formed. A team that is ready to take on the task of Going For their 
Gold in putting on a great conclave.The theme for this year’s conclave is “The Great Southwest 
Centennial Fest.” And as the theme suggests, this year’s conclave hopes to be one of the best 
the section has seen yet! </p>
