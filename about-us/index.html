<h2>Purpose of the Order of the Arrow</h2>

  <li>Promote camping, responsible outdoor adventure, and environmental stewardship as essential components of every Scout's experience, in the unit, year-round, and in summer camp.</li>
  <li>Develop leaders with the willingness, character, spirit and ability to advance the activities of their units, our Brotherhood, Scouting, and ultimately our nation.</li>
  <li>Crystallize the Scout habit of helpfulness into a life purpose of leadership in cheerful service to others.</li>
