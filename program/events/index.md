# Region Events

The primary events for the Western Region are the training opportunities to attend a National Leadership Seminar (NLS), National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS) or a Developing Youth Leaders Conference (DYLC). These events are held throughout the region, and throughout the year. We also hold special gatherings and events, as well as participating heavily in national Order of the Arrow events.
