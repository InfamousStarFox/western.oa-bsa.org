# Region Events

The primary events for the Western Region are the training opportunities to attend a National Leadership Seminar (NLS), National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS) or a Developing Youth Leaders Conference (DYLC). These events are held throughout the region, and throughout the year. We also hold special gatherings and events, as well as participating heavily in national Order of the Arrow events.

# National Events

### National Order of the Arrow Conference

Every two years, Arrowmen from across the country gather on the campus of a major university for the National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC).

The National Order of the Arrow Conference is Scouting's second-largest national program event. The reason for its growing popularity can be attributed to the fact that it is planned and carried out by Arrowmen themselves. Youth involvement ensures that the conference program will be exciting, relevant, and non-stop fun.

These gatherings draw over 7000 Arrowmen, traveling from as far away as Europe and Asia, for five days of training, fun, and fellowship. With each conference, NOAC becomes more diversified, more fun, and more exciting.

NOAC has many different aspects and it is impossible to participate in every event in one year. Each year events are added and changed so you could go to NOAC every time and do new things each time. The main activities at NOAC include training, ceremonies evaluation, American Indian events, shows, competitions, and Founder's Day. NOAC has something for everyone of all backgrounds and all ages. It is definitely one of Scouting's most unique and entertaining training events.

# World Scouting Events

### World Scout Jamboree

The World Scout Jamboree (WSJ) is held every four years and this will be the first WSJ with an OA contingent. The event will bring 40,000 Scouts from 114 countries together to share international friendship and provide adventure for personal growth and development. Imagine camping next to a Scout unit from Poland, eating lunch with Scouts from Chile, trading uniforms and insignia with Scouts from Greece, and playing games with Scouts from Thailand. The possibilities are endless and the memories are forever!

The Western Region will be sending several troops to the WSJ based on geographic location. Scouts from neighboring councils will join together in representing the BSA to the world. This jamboree will include an opportunity for Western Region Arrowmen to attend the event as one unit! As part of the unit, Scouts will have the opportunity to develop region wide brotherhood, participate in leadership development and share ideas to strengthen the region.
