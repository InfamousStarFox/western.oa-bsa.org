# Developing Youth Leaders Conference

The 2016 Developing Youth Leaders Conference (DYLC) will be like nothing before it. This conference focuses on the tools every adult needs to mentor and develop our outstanding youth leaders. It is built on the concepts our members learn at the National Leadership Seminar, and it uses the NLS terminology as participants learn new tools and techniques of how to mentor and develop our outstanding youth leaders. Prior attendance at a NLS is encouraged, but it is not required for the DYLC. Adults who are unsure whether NLS or DYLC might be best for them should talk to their lodge adviser for guidance or e-mail [training@western.oa-bsa.org](mailto:training@western.oa-bsa.org).

Developing Youth Leaders Conference was first presented as an alpha test to guests at NOAC 2015. The beta version was offered to section advisers who attended the 2015 National Planning Meeting in Dallas.

Since participation in NEXT, the national program of emphasis in 2016, is limited to just two adults per lodge, this is the perfect year to attend the most unique and rewarding adviser training in years.

Consider encouraging another adviser in your lodge to come with you and make it even more special. As a suggestion, lodge advisers might consider bringing a couple of their key chapter advisers with them as well.

Come join us for a conference that might just be life changing for you, your family and the Order.

Registration will begin at 6 p.m. Friday evening. First session will start promptly at 8:00 p.m. The conference will conclude at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.

Participants are on their own for their Friday evening meal (with the exception of Granlibakken - Lake Tahoe). The first meal for the participants will be breakfast on Saturday morning.
