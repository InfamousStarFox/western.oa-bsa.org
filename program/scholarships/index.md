# OA High Adventure Scholarship

The Western Region Order of the Arrow Committee feels so strongly that the OA High Adventure program leaves a lasting impression and energizes the arrowmen that participate they would like to offer each and every Lodge in the Western Region a $300 scholarship that can be used to cover participation fees for any one of the following four Order of the Arrow High Adventure programs in the summer of 2017:

1.	OA Trail Crew at Philmont Scout Ranch
2.	Wilderness Voyage at the Charles L Sommers Canoe Base
3.	Canadian Odyssey at the Charles L Sommers Canoe Base
4.	Summit Experience at the Summit Bechtel Reserve

Please Note:

*	Participants will need to provide your own transportation.
*	Scholarship money cannot be used for OA Ocean Adventure.
*	The Western Region will not register on your behalf. You must follow the normal application process.
